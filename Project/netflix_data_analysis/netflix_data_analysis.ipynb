       "'\\nStrategy 1: Fill with a Placeholder (Jagya Purvi)\\n    - This is the most common and safest approach for text columns like cast and director.\\n    - What to do: Instead of leaving the cells blank, we can fill them with a placeholder word like \"Unknown\", \"Not Available\", or \"No Director\".\\n    - Why it\\'s a good idea:\\n        - No Data Loss: We don\\'t have to delete the entire row. We can still use the information from other columns like release_year, country, and rating for our analysis.\\n        - Clarity: It clearly tells us that the information was missing, not that the movie had no director or cast.\\n        - Easy Analysis: We can later easily count how many movies have an \"Unknown\" director or filter them out if needed.\\n\\nStrategy 2: Do Nothing (Kaai Na Karvu)\\n    - Sometimes, the best action is no action.\\n    - What to do: Leave the missing values as they are (NaN).\\n    - Why it might work:\\n        - Specific Analysis: If you are only analyzing trends by country or release year, the director and cast columns don\\'t matter. Pandas is smart enough to ignore missing values during many calculations (like counting).\\n        - Honesty: It keeps the data in its original, raw state.\\n    - The downside: This can cause errors or unexpected results in certain analyses, especially if you try to search for a specific director\\'s name.\\n\\nStrategy 3: Deleting Rows (Rows Kadhi Nakhvi)\\n    - This is a more aggressive approach and generally not recommended for these columns.\\n    - What to do: Delete any row where the director or cast information is missing.\\n    - Why it\\'s risky:\\n        - Major Data Loss: The director column has thousands of missing values. Deleting all those rows would mean throwing away a large portion of our dataset (almost 30%). This would make our overall analysis much less reliable.\\n'"
