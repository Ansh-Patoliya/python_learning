"""
üîπ Class
    - A blueprint / template for creating objects.
    - Defines attributes (data) and methods (functions/behavior).

    - Example: Car design / plan.

        class Car:
            def __init__(self, brand, model):
                self.brand = brand
                self.model = model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîπ Object
    - A real instance of a class.
    - Stores actual data.

    - Example: Real car made from the design.

        car1 = Car("Toyota", "Fortuner")   # object
        car2 = Car("Tesla", "Model X")     # object
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîπ Key Differences
    - Class = Definition, Object = Instance.
    - Class does not hold data directly ‚Üí Objects hold data.
    - One class can create many objects.
    - Class = Idea, Object = Reality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìå Analogy:
    - Class = Pizza Recipe üçï
    - Object = Actual Pizza you eat.

###########################################################################
'''
üîπAttributes (Variables inside a Class)
    - Attributes = data/variables that belong to a class or object.
    - There are two types:
        (a) Instance Attributes:
            - Belong to each object individually.
            - Defined inside __init__ using self.
            - Every object has its own separate copy.
            
        (b) Class Attributes
            - Shared by all objects.
            - Defined outside __init__, directly inside class.
            
üîπMethods (Functions inside a Class)
    - Methods define behavior (actions) of objects.
    - There are 3 types of methods in Python:            
        (a) Instance Methods
            - Work with instance attributes.
            - Take self as the first parameter.
            - Can access & modify object‚Äôs attributes.
            
        (b) Class Methods
            - Work with class attributes.
            - Use a special decorator @classmethod.
            - Take cls (class) as the first parameter instead of self.
            
        (c) Static Methods
            - General utility methods, don‚Äôt use self or cls.
            - Use @staticmethod decorator.
            - Behaves like a normal function but kept inside a class for organization.

# Example to illustrate different types of variables and methods in a class
class Student:

print(f"s1 object can access class variable = {s1.school_name}")
print(f"class can access class variable = {Student.school_name}")
