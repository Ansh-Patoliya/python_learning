# Matplotlib: Pyplot vs Object-Oriented Interface

A quick side-by-side comparison of the two main ways to use Matplotlib.

| Aspect        | Pyplot Interface (plt)                               | Object-Oriented Interface (ax)                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Idea     | State-based; acts on the "current" plot.             | Object-based; acts on specific plot objects.             |
| Control       | Implicit and automatic.                               | Explicit and precise control over all elements.          |
| Syntax        | Uses functions like `plt.title()`.                    | Uses methods like `ax.set_title()`.                      |
| Best For      | Quick, simple, interactive plots.                     | Complex plots, subplots, and reusable functions.         |
| Clarity       | Can become ambiguous with multiple plots.             | Clear and unambiguous, even in complex figures.          |
| Recommendation| Good for initial data exploration.                    | The preferred, more powerful, professional standard.     |
